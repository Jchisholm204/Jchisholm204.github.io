            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                CAL, or CAN bus Abstraction Layer, was originally proposed by our
                Electrical Team lead Ethan Peterson back in 2020 and was the first
                major project I completed as part of the Queen’s Formula SAE Team.
                <br/><br/>
                The purpose of CAL is simple. Provide a simplified interface for
                programmers to work with the CAN bus.  CAL currently supports
                encoding and decoding of MoTec PDM (Power Distribution Module)
                and ECU (Engine Control Unit) as well as our QFSAE Dashboard
                messages.<br/><br/>
                In order to understand the workings of CAL, we must first
                understand the basics of the CAN bus itself, and how the
                MoTec ECU and PDM transmit different types of data.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h2>The CAN Bus</h2>
                <p>
                    The CAN (Controller Area Network) Bus was originally developed
                    in 1986 to simplify automotive wiring.  While many newer cars
                    are transferring to ethernet as an alternative communication
                    method, the CAN bus is still widely used for a variety of
                    applications due to being able to hold its signal integrity
                    within high noise environments.<br/><br/>
                    Data is sent through the CAN bus in the format of CAN messages.
                    CAN messages contain an 11 bit identifier followed by up to a
                    maximum of 8 8-bit unsigned integers. The identifier is
                    typically referred to as an ID and is used to differentiate
                    sending devices.  For example, the MoTec ECU uses ID’s 0x118
                    and 0x119 in order to send out different data.  The ECU uses
                    ID’s 0x7F0 and 0x7F1 for its data. Within the program, this
                    data is stored within the CAN_msg_t structure, seen below.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">
typedef struct {
    uint32_t id;        /* 29 bit identifier                               */
    uint8_t  data[8];   /* Data field                                      */
    uint8_t  len;       /* Length of data field in bytes                   */
    uint8_t  ch;        /* Object channel(Not use)                         */
    uint8_t  format;    /* 0 - STANDARD, 1- EXTENDED IDENTIFIER            */
    uint8_t  type;      /* 0 - DATA FRAME, 1 - REMOTE FRAME                */
} CAN_msg_t;
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    The 8 8-bit unsigned integers are contained within an array,
                    while the identifier is stored in a 32-bit integer.  IDs are
                    typically stored as hexadecimal values.

                    <h2>The QFSAE Dependency Library</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before continuing, we must briefly mention the QFSAE
                        dependency library.  As the CAN_msg_t structure needs
                        to be accessed by both the CAL library, the st-f4CAN
                        library, as well as future libraries, it was moved
                        into its own library to reduce declaration conflicts
                        between libraries. The dependencies library was then
                        added as a dependency library of these libraries to
                        allow passing of message structures between them.
                        As well as allowing development to be more streamlined,
                        this design choice also allows users of these libraries
                        to pass data between one another using one-liners.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <h2>Internal Data Storage</h2>
                        <p>
                            Currently, CAL is capable of both decoding and
                            encoding CAN bus data.  In the original implementation
                            of CAL, only decoding was possible. However, when
                            starting to work on other QFSAE projects such as
                            the dash, it became necessary to implement an
                            encoding mechanism. As such, CAL went to being
                            a collection of functions to a class.<br/><br/>
                            The main reason for the move from a set of
                            functions to a class implementation was so that
                            CAL could be capable of internally storing data.
                            In the end implementation, this allows users to
                            call the update variable method, followed by the
                            package method in order to encode and send messages
                            across the bus.
                            An example implementation is featured below.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include "Arduino.h"

CAL::CAL cal;

void setup() {
    // Initialize CAN Bus at 500 kb/s
    bool ret = CANInit(CAN_500KBPS, 0, 2);
    while(!ret);
}
CAN_msg_t can_msg;

uint8_t can_ch1 = 1;
uint8_t can_ch2 = 2;

void loop() {
    cal.updateVar(CAL::DATA_ECU::EngineRPM, (cal.returnVar(CAL::DATA_ECU::EngineRPM) + 100));
    CANSend(can_ch2, &cal.package(CAL::MOTEC_ID::ECU_2));
    delay(100);

                        <p>
                            Another benefit of storing data internally is that in removes
                            the need for data to be stored by the end user.  This provides
                            the benefit of decreased memory usage, and the ability to
                            retrieve the data from the last received message.

                            <p>
                                When using CAL, the first step is to pass data
                                (in the form of CAN messages) into the library to be decoded.
                                This can easily be done through the update package method.
                            </p>
                            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Arduino Example
if(can.checkReceive() == CAN_MSGAVAIL){
    CAN_msg_t can_recv;
    can.readMsgBuf(&can_recv.len, can_recv.data);
    can_recv.id = can.getCanId();
    cal.updatePackage(can_recv);
}

// STM32 Example
if(CANCheckReceive()){
    CAN_msg_t can_recv;
    CANReceive(can_ch1, &can_recv);

                                The main advantage of calling this method is that it
                                automatically identifies the correct storage container
                                based off the messages ID. At a user level, the
                                implementation featured above is all that is required
                                by the user. However, while the user may believe this
                                is where decoding takes place, the CAL program does not
                                actually decode any data at this step. The program simply
                                updates its internal data structure with the data coming
                                in off of the bus.  If the message is unknown, IE there
                                exists no internal data structure with a matching ID,
                                CAL simply ignores the incoming message.

                                    Now that CAL is receiving data off of the CAN bus, the
                                    return variable function can be called in order to access
                                    the data.  The function is overloaded to support different
                                    variable types and has two different ways it can return data.
                                    <br/>
                                    The first way data can be returned is return by reference.
                                    The advantage of using this method is that it supports many
                                    data types including regular integers, floats, booleans and
                                    unsigned 8-bit integers.

                                    The second method for returning data is by utilizing the
                                    standard function return.  This method is useful for one-liners.
                                    However, it carries the main disadvantage that it can only
                                    return integers and boolean values in the form of integers.
                                    Therefore, it will not work when accessing floats.

                                        the CAN bus and out of CAN messages, the update method is
                                        used to encode data into CAN_msg_t packets that can then
                                        be sent over the bus. The update variable function takes
                                        two parameters, and similarly to the return variable method,
                                        is overloaded to support many data types.  The first
                                        parameter is the data that you would like to update, and
                                        the second is the updated value.  Examples using the update

                                            messages among other errors. When using CAL alongside the
                                            st-f4CAN library, CAN messages can be sent out with a one liner.

                                            In order to make CAL more accessible to both people on QFSAE and to
                                            others using the MoTec ECU and PDM, CAL has been published on the
                                            PlatformIO library registry.  As we continue to update data structures,
                                            new versions of CAL will be published, although it is unlikely to affect
                                            anything displayed here.
