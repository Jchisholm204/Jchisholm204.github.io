        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="page-content">
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>CAL was the first project I completed for the Queens Formula SAE Team.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Originally proposed by Electrical Team Lead Ethan 
                Peterson, CAL (CAN Abstraction Layer) works to 
                provide a simple method for dealing with CAN messages
                coming from the MoTec ECU (Engine Control Unit) and
                PDM (Power Distribution Module).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>The CAN Bus</h2>
            <p>The CAN (Controller Area Network) bus was originally 
                developed in 1986 to simplify automotive wiring. 
                While many newer cars are transferring to Ethernet
                as an alternative communication method, the CAN bus
                is still widely used for a variety of applications 
                including FSAE.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>The CAN Message</h2>
            <p>CAN messages contain an 11 bit identifier followed 
                by 8 8 bit messages.  The identifier can be contained
                as an unsigned 32 bit integer and is usually 
                represented by a hexadecimal identifier.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>CAN messages are represented within the program
                through the CAN_msg_t structure.  This structure
                contains all of the information about a particular
                message as well as the data within the message.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>The 'data' Structure</h2>
            <p>The data structure contains all of the necessary
                information to convert CAN messages into usable
                data.  Since the MoTec ECU and PDM send out data
                types other than unsigned 8 bit integers, it is
                important to keep track of all the data emitted
                by these devices, as well as how they format the
                data.  For example, both the ECU uses boolean
                values to indicate the state of physical switches. 
                In order to retrieve the Boolean values, bit shifting
                and type conversion must be used.  The data struct
                stores all of the information needed to complete
                this transformation including the CAN ID, position
                of the data frame and bit shift to apply.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>In order to make CAL more versatile, the user
                is still responsible for finding another means
                of receiving the CAN message.  While this
                complicates things for the end user, it allows
                CAL to be used with a variety of microcontrollers
                and CAN bus interface devices.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Once the user has finished the hardware side
                implementation, they can include the library
                in their Arduino project.  From there its as
                simple as calling the update method and passing
                in the received CAN message, the premade data
                structure that corresponds to the data they would
                like to extract, as well as the variable where
                they would like to store the information.  The
                CAN message and CAN data are pass by reference
                while they return value is pass by pointer.
                The update method returns 0 upon success or
                >0 if there is a failure along any point.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>The Update Method</h2>
            <p>The Update method, while not necessary,
                is a helpful tool that makes extracting
                data off the bus much easier than the
                alternative of doing it manually.  After
                all, why write your own code when a library
                has already done it for you?</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The update method takes three arguments
                and returns the value through pass by
                pointer.  The arguments are the CAN message
                received in the form of the CAN_msg_t
                structure and the CAN data to extract
                in the form of the data structure. The
                third argument is overloaded for use of
                multiple data types and is used to return
                the value through pass by pointer.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The first thing the update method checks for
                is if the ID of the message matches the ID
                of the data.  If it matches, the method
                continues or, if it fails, the method returns
                1 indicating incorrect ID.</p>
            <code>
                // Return 1 on incorrect CAN ID
                if(!(msg.id == CANdata.id)) return 1;
            </code>
            <p>Once it is known that the ID is correct, the
                method checks to ensure that the datatype of
                the data matches the datatype of the return
                variable passed into the function.</p>
            <code>
                // Check datatypes
                if(CANdata.dataType == DataType::uint8){
                    *data = (msg.data[CANdata.start_idx] & CANdata.bitmask)*CANdata.multiplier;
                    return 0;
                }
                else if(CANdata.dataType == DataType::int16){
                    *data = ((((int16_t)msg.data[CANdata.start_idx + 1] << 8) | msg.data[CANdata.start_idx]) & CANdata.bitmask)*CANdata.multiplier;
                    return 0;
                }
            </code>
            <p>Finally, the type conversions, bit shifting,
                and multipliers are added in order to transform
                the data into its final form.  Shown above is
                the data conversion for integers, below is the
                data conversion for Booleans.  Float data types
                are converted the same way as integers but are
                cast to float and a non-zero 1> multiplier is
                applied to finalize the conversion.</p>
                <code>
                    // Perform bitmask and evaluate (true | false)
                    *data = (msg.data[CANdata.start_idx] & CANdata.bitmask) > 0;
                </code>
