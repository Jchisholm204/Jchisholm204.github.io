            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Recently I visited my hometown of Vancouver, BC.  While there,
                I decided to take a trip to Lee's Electronics Store where among
                many other things, I picked up some two digit 7 segment displays.
                I thought getting them up and running would be a simple and fun
                project to get some experience working with micro-controllers
                and breadboards.
            </p>
            <h2>7 Segment Displays</h2>
            <p>
                7 Segment displays are very interesting little devices.
                Even more interesting than the devices is how we drive them.
                First off, 7 Segment displays primarily come with two types
                of internal wiring: Common Cathode and common Anode. When
                driving the displays with a micro controller such as an ESP32
                as I did, the only difference it makes is how you write the program.
            </p>
            <h2>Driving 7 Segment Displays</h2>
            <p>
                Driving 7 Segment displays is all about voltage control.
                In order to fully understand how to drive these displays,
                we must first know that LED's emit light based on a difference
                in voltage between their anode and cathode. Specifically, the
                anode must have a higher voltage than the cathode. Normally,
                we would turn an led on and off by applying a voltage to the
                anode and current would flow through the led and into ground.
                Then, when we want to turn the led off, we can simply remove
                the voltage.  However, since light is generated through a
                voltage drop across the LED, we can also turn the LED off through
                the addition of voltage onto the cathode, thus removing the voltage
                potential and turning the LED off.  This is the basic principle of
                how we can drive a seven segment display. Though maybe not useful
                when only driving a single digit, this method allows us to drive
                additional digits with only one extra wire.
            </p>
            <h2>The Programming</h2>
            <p>
                In this project I used common anode displays. This means that when
                controlling the displays, I had to set the digit pin I wanted to
                use to HIGH and and set the segment I wanted lit up to LOW. That way
                a positive voltage potential is created between the LEDs anode (digit pin)
                and its cathode (segment pin). Controlling additional digits simply requires
                switching the pins fast enough so that the correct segment and digit pins
                are set to the right values at the right time. Something you may notice
                with my code example given below is that the numbers array was actually set
                up for common cathode displays while the rest of the program is set up for
                common anode displays. Therefore for my project I actually inverted the array
                using the C++ ! keyword.
            </p>
            <h2>The Counter Program</h2>
            <p>
                The counter program is the simple program you see below. It includes some example
                code for controlling the 7 segment display as well as displaying an incrementing
                number on it. This code is is very similar to something like a clock, and could be
                easily modified for such a purpose. <br/>
                Making a counter program in itself is a very simple task.  However, when trying to
                display it on a 7 segment display, there are some factors we must take into consideration.
                The most of important of which is overflow. <br/>
                Within my example problem, I controlled overflow by creating 5 separate variables. The
                first of which is timer, this variable stores the number of milliseconds that have passed
                in order to determine when to update the number on the display. Four other variables; a, b,
                c, and d are used to store the number that is displayed on the digits. In my example, I had
                four digits, therefore, I also had four variables. The program from this point on is quite simple.
                Add one to the last digit, if that number is over 9 (the maximum value a single digit can have)
                then set that digit to zero and add one to the digit on the left.  Following this procedure
                the display is able to count 0009, 0010, 0011, ..., 2184 and so on.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                All in all this was a very fun little project and I enjoyed sharing what I learned.
                Since seeing this style of control I have come up with many new ideas for future projects.
                Some of which expansions are simple expansions of what was done here.  Either way this was
                a good project to get a little bit of experience working with ESP32, 7 segment displays,
                and breadboards.
