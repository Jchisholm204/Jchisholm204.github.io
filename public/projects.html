                <p class="article-descript">
                    In order to further my knowledge of FPGA logic and VHDL I created a simple Pong game. <br>
                    While simple on the surface, this project required three clocked processes, a VGA signal
                    generator and some interesting logic.

                <p class="article-descript">
                    A few weeks before I started this project, my friend sent me a video of a lab that he had completed for school.
                    The lab consisted of wiring and programming an Arduino and some seven segment displays to display the decimal
                    number corresponding to the binary number imputed by 8 dip switches. <br>
                    Having just picked up an Altera DE2 development board from Facebook marketplace, I thought that recreating
                    this project would be the perfect way to get an introduction to FPGA programming. Thus, the 8-bit dipswitch project was born.

                    CAL: CAN Abstraction Layer<br />
                    A project originally proposed by our team lead Ethan Peterson,
                    CAL serves the main purpose of simplifying the interaction between programmers and
                    the CAN bus. Specifically between programmers and the MoTec ECU and PDM devices.
                    <br/> CAL, alongside its dependency library, is a published PlatformIO Library.

                    Within this project I learned about the internal workings of a 7 segment display.

                    While simple on its own, the knowledge gained within this project will be useful
                    for planned projects such as the wifi synced clock and LED wall.

                    The electronics for this CNC had been sitting around for a while and the robotics lab had wanted to have
                    a second CNC for lighter materials like lexan for some time. So when another student ordered and built the
                    physical part of the CNC, I decided to spend a few hours one day doing the electronics board and wiring.

                <p class="article-descript">
                    While building the 2022 World Championship robot, we decided to take a break and have some
                    fun by making an FRC GoKart. Powered by two old NEO motors and a half broken RoboRio, the
                    Kart actually worked much better than expected. Since the code is nothing but some simple
                    drive code and the physical Kart was janked together within the span of an hour, this page
                    is simply a place where I can put up some pictures and a video to remember this fun day.
