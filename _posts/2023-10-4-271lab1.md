Currently I am enrolled in ELEC271: Digital Systems. The labs for this course are designed to be completed using block diagrams in Quartus. However, I obtained permission to do the labs in VHDL.

## Purpose

The purpose of this lab was to explore the relationship between OR, AND and XOR gates. 

## Execution

In order to do this we will provide two buttons as the input to these gates, and assign their outputs to LEDS.

#### Debouncer

In order to obtain clean signals from the buttons, we need to employ the use of a debouncer. The reason for this is that while we may want to believe that buttons either register as pressed or not pressed, in reality they have a transitory period in between being pressed or released where the voltage output from the button "bounces" between high and low. In order to solve this problem, two methods can be employed. First is the use of a capacitor to smooth the voltage output. Since we cannot modify the hardware of the DE2 board, we will use a debouncer made in software.
