Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Jacob Chisholm. I graduated from Rockridge Secondary School in 2022 and I'm currently attending Queen's University for Computer and Electrical Engineering in the ECE innovation program (ECEi).

## My Interests
I'm always looking for the next challenge. I started while working on VEX robotics thinking I wanted to go into mechanical engineering. I then started programming for VEX and quickly progressed into First Robotics. While competing, I found that robotics and control systems were among my main interests. Now, I am am mostly interested in embedded development, and low level computer design.

## My History

#### Queen's Racing

I am currently the Electrical and Firmware Co-Lead aboard Queen's Formula SAE Racing Team. This season we are working on the transition from a combustion engine to a fully electric vehicle. I look forward to the year ahead and the challenges it will present.

#### Queen's University

I am Currently enrolled in Queen's University Electrical and Computer Engineering Innovation program (ECEi). In addition to my responsibilities aboard the Racing team, I am also a member of the Engineering Society's Professional Development team. Having finally completed my first year of study, I look forward to what future years entail.

#### Ten Ton Robotics

The West Vancouver Ten Ton Robotics Academy was a premiere part of my life. While competing I learned so many valuable skills not only about building robots and programming, but also about team dynamics and leadership. From competing on a team with one other in grade 9, to volunteering and running tournaments, and finally leading a team of 20+ people to world championships in grade 12.
