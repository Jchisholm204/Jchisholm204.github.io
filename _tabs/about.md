### Hey there!

#### Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Jacob Chisholm. I was born and raised in Vancouver BC and I'm currently living in Kingston Ontario attending Queen's University for Computer Engineering. When I'm not working on one of my projects I enjoy being outside on the mountains either skiing or biking. When I'm not on the hills you can usually find me down at the marina or out on the ocean.

Some of my main interests at the moment include embedded development and computer architecture. I also enjoy PCB design and working on wiring harnesses. In the past I've worked on competitive robotics teams, competing in VEX EDR provincials tournaments and the First Robotics World Championships.

Below is a brief overview of some of my skills and experience. References are available upon request.
